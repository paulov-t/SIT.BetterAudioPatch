## Summary

A just for fun learning exercise of Unity's Audio system. A mod for SPT-Aki and Stay in Tarkov.

### Aims

* More directionality (done)
* Detection of "floors" to try and create a sound system like Rainbow Six Seige (not started)
* More realistic footsteps, so you cannot hear footsteps from outside a building/room, whilst inside a building/room, unless a door or window is open (not started)
* More realistic gunshots (work in progress, only works on single shot weapons, for now)

## How to use this Repo?

Install SIT.BetterAudioPatch.dll to the BepInEx/plugins folder in the Client
